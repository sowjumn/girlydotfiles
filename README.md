As we all know there are a lot of dotfiles out there. But I dont want everything in the world. I want a clean setup which is pretty basic with colors for directories and the path set to /usr/local/bin and the prompt is hostname@pwd. Thats it. If you are interested in using my basic dotfiles clone this repository and copy the .bashrc, .bash_profile and .aliases file into your home directory
